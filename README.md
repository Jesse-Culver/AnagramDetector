A program that when given a word or phrase checks to see if it is an anagram for a single English word.

For example the word "silent" returns
enlist
inlets
listen
silent
slinte
tinsel

Red Rum returns
murder

In the future I would like to give it the ability to check for multiple words and or phrases

Word list is from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
